# planTIF

Pipeline to analyse TIF-Seq data is performed in R
The required libraries are as follow: GenomicRanges,TxDb.Athaliana.BioMart.plantsmart28,rtracklayer,ggplot2,biomaRt,BSgenome.Athaliana.TAIR.TAIR9,reshape,scales,SummarizedExperiment,CAGEfightR,BiocParallel,tibble,dplyr,VennDiagram...

The script "TIF-Seq_pipeline_v2.R" will load the required packages and download the genomic information for arabidopsis for the rest of the scripts

if scripts are not found here they can be found at https://github.com/Maxim-Ivanov/Nielsen_et_al_2018. from Nielsen et al, 2019
