All TIF-Seq clusters were called using the script TIF-Seq_isoform_clustering_v6.py and then converted to .bed files

From .bed files all analysis were performed in R

The script "TIF-Seq_pipeline_v2.R" will load the required R packages and download the genomic information for arabidopsis for the rest of the scripts

if scripts are not found here they can be found at https://github.com/Maxim-Ivanov/Nielsen_et_al_2018. from Nielsen et al, 2019

Each script refer to other scripts containing important function or algorythms
